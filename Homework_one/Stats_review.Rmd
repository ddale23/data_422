## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#Linear Regression 
```{r}

guppy_regression = lm(guppy_data$fatherOrnamentation ~ guppy_data$sonAttractiveness)

summary(lm(guppy_data$fatherOrnamentation ~ guppy_data$sonAttractiveness))

```

## yhat = b0 + b1x

## bo = intercept
## b1 = slope

## interpretation of slope: for every unit increase in FatherOrnamentation, son attractiveness increases by 0.9823 units

## when using linear regression, the following assumptions myst be met for all tests and predictions:

## at each value of X, there is a population of possible y values, whose mean lies on the true regression line (this is the assumption that the relationship must be linear)

## at each value of X, the distribution of possible Y-values is normal
## the variance of Y-Values is the same at all values of X (homskedasicity)

##at each value of X, the Y-measurements reporesent a random sample form the population of possible Y values



## yhat = Beta0 + Beta1 * xi

## Error = True Values - Observed Values
## Error Assumptions:
1. Linearity: The Relationship between X and Y must be linear
2. Independence of Errors: There should be no error that is dependent on Y
3. Normality of Errors
4. Equal Variances of Errors (Homoscedasticity)


Residual: how far the observed values fall from the estimated model


Residual plots

```{r}

residuals(guppy_regression)


```



```{r}
#### Residual Diagnosis ####

## Linearity Assumption

## checking this assumption by examining a scatterplot of x and y
## the residual plot shows no major deviations from the assumptions of linear regression.

##for the Indepence of Errors: Residuals vs fitted plot
plot(guppy_regression)

##assumption is not violated as there is not a pattern to the data

## Q-Q plot: Normal distribution plot
## a q-q plot --> if on a straight line, does not violate
## -- can also get a histogram of the residual OR normality test (Shapiro Wilk test)


```

Assumption of Linear Regression
1. Linearity --> Scatterplot of X & Y
2. Independence of Errors --> Scatterplot of fitted values (yhat) and residuals (y-yhat)
3. Normality --> QQ plot
4. Equality of Variance --> Scatterplot of fitted values (yhat) and residuals (y-yhat)

(Both assumption 2 & 4 use the same diagnostic plot)



Independence of Errors assumptions are not violated as we do not observe any relationship/pattern in the plot




## Normality of Errors: The residuals myst be approximately normally distributed
Check this assumption by observing a QQ plot

the observations of the sample should be near the line. You can also examine a histogram of the residuals -- it should be approximately normally distributed. Or you could do a Shapiro-Wilk normality test






Based on QQ plot from above, there are a few outliers that impact the shape of the error distribution from being normal. Otherwise, most of the observations are almost on a straight line


## Equality of Variances of error
The variance of residuals is the same for all values of X
Check this assumption by examining the scatterplot of residuals vs fitted
Want to find that the variance of the residuals is the same for all values of X
If the plot shows a pattern (ex: bowl of funnel shape) then variances are not constant and this assumption is violated



Her example was met; mine had a V occurring, which showed a pattern.





##Hypothesis testing on parameters
H0: B1 = 0 
Ha: B1 != 0

If we reject Ha, then we violate the Linearity assumption as: Y = B0 + B1 x + E becomes Y = B0 + E, which is a line parralel to the x axis. There would be no linearity.

```{r}
## Testing of Hypothesis

summary(guppy_regression)


```
# this supports that we rare supposed to reject H0; since 6.78e-05 is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is significant linear relationship between son's attractiveness and father ornamentation


# I have Son Attractiveness to predict Father Ornamentation. It should be other way around(Banorjee has Father Ornamentation to predict Son Attractiveness)
